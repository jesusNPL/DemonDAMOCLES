# FurnariidesDAMOCLES
This is a repository for our paper "Drivers of phylogenetic assemblage structure of the Furnariides, a widespread clade of
lowland Neotropical birds" accepted in The American Naturalist

The repository includes the R functions to run DAMOCLES model over multiple assemblages and to simulate colonization and extinction rates under know parameters following Pigot & Etienne 2015. This respository also includes the R scripts for plotting the results.

"DemonDAMOCLES" is a R function to run DAMOCLES model (r package DAMOCLES; Pigot & Etienne 2015 Ecology Letters 18, 153-163) for multiple local assemblages in parallel.

If you want to replicate our results, please download the Furnariides phylogeny and the assemblage data set from the Dryad repository: https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.h3390h5

Note: Damocles model is very time-consuming.
